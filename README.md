# marling-discord-game-bot

If you have just cloned the repo, run the following

```
yarn install
```

This will fetch all the dependencies.

You will need to create a .env file (there is a template) with the appropriate client secret and Mongo DB.
The client secret can be retrieved from the Discord Developer Portal.

Then run the following to start the bot.

```
yarn start
```

If you want to develop the bot, and for it to restart each time a source file changes, run the following

```
yarn dev
```
